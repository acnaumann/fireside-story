    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>They were dancing in seaweed covered tutu's sequinced with the glimmer of sand, and seashells as random as the splatter of paint filled ballons being broken agaisnt a white wall. </p>
    <p>lighting struck</p>
    <p>A loud thunder fallowed the fire started by the skys light, and dancing stopped. Everyone crowded around the embers, and smoke of the communities center tree. Some were crying, 
      and holding hands as this had been a staple of the animals, and creatures that had been among them. This tree sustainded life in a way no one had ever seen before. </p>
    <p>Just when all hope was lost, the clouds parted and the sun shone through. </p>
    <p>Then everyone died from the heat of the uncovered sun. The end.</p>
    <p>dedicated to the northern flamingo of the sea</p>
